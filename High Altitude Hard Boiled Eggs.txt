High Altitude Hard Boiled Eggs

1) Set eggs on counter 10-15 minutes before you intend to cook them. Cold 
eggs straight from the fridge are more likely to crack when you're 
cooking them.

2) Bring a large pot of water to a boil. (Make sure you have enough water 
to cover the eggs completely and that the pot is big enough for the eggs 
to be in a single layer.)

3) Using a large spoon, slowly and carefully lower the eggs down into the 
boiling water. Cook eggs for 15 minutes. Turn burner off and let eggs sit 
another 3 minutes.

4) Drain off the hot water and add cold water to cover the eggs. I let 
the water cold water run a minute or two over the eggs before taking them 
out of the pan and letting them cool completely back in the egg carton.

5) Store cooled eggs in the refrigerator.
